# CustomBLD 

CustomBLD is a tool for generating custom BLD scrambles.
It is a database of ~20 million scrambles and solutions for 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 BLD events.
It allows you to choose and customize specific scrambles types for what you want to practice.

Feel free to contact me if you have ideas or need help,

## üéØ Why is it good for?

- Training hard scrambles (scrambles with 3twists, 4flips, many cycle breaks)
- Trainig easy scrambles - get used to easy sceambles so you don't panic when you one in a competition
- Training excecution only (with the solution provided)
- Training 3-style subsets with real solves (you can choose which letter pairs to practice)
- etc...

## ‚ú® Features

- Letter pair solutions for each solve with detailed stats. For example:

```rubik
D' L2 B2 U' F2 U' L2 F2 U' B2 L' D' R B2 U2 F' U L F U2 Rw'

Rotations: x
Edges: TB UW AV JH EM Flips: L
Length: 10
Cycle breaks: 1
Solved edges: 1

Corners: XF QV WG Twist Ccw: A
Length: 6
```

- Customize your letter scheme to match your preferred language and letter positions
- Choose your own buffer pieces
- Customize scrambles for each piece type (Corners, Edges, Wings, T-centers, X-centers) based on:
  - Number of algorithms in the solutions
  - Presence of parity
  - Number of edge flips
  - Number of corner twists
  - Number of solved pieces
  - Number of cycle breaks
- Generate up to 1000 scrambles
- Copy the scrambles easily and paste them in your favorite timer 
- CSV export


## üöÄ If you want to generate scrambles yourself

You are welcome to use this code for your projects.
I've designed it to be as convenient and easy to set up as possible.

You can easily:
1. Run a local instance of the website
2. Generate a scrambles database for your specific needs (particular buffer combinations, larger quantities of specific events)

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RotoHands/CustomBLD.git
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Running the Website Locally

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Navigate to `CustomBLD/CustomBLD/` and run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access the website at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser

### üìù Important Notes

- The database file must be named `all_solves_db.backup`
- When replacing the database file, run `docker-compose down -v` to ensure Docker loads the new database
- After updating the database, clear `stats_cache.json` to force a new stats query (occurs every 24 hours)

## üíæ Databases

Download the database in your preferred format:

1. SQLite database
2. PostgreSQL database (this file you can put in CusomBLD\CustomBLD\custombld_db and it will be loaded to the website)

### üîÑ Restoring the Database Locally

I will recommand to use put the db file in scramble_generation\dbsolves or in CusomBLD\CustomBLD\custombld_db and when you will run the docker-compose up --build and will automativally restore it.

if you want to restore the db locally on your machine you can use this script (this is the script that is running in the dockers)
<details>
<summary>Click to view database restoration script</summary>

Create a file named `restore.sh` in your database directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting phased database restore for better performance..."

# Phase 1: Restore schema only (without data and indexes)
echo "Phase 1: Restoring schema only..."
pg_restore -v --no-owner --no-privileges --section=pre-data \
    --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB" \
    /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/all_solves_db.backup

# Phase 2: Restore data only (fast, without index maintenance)
echo "Phase 2: Restoring data only (without indexes)..."
pg_restore -v --no-owner --no-privileges --section=data --jobs=4 \
    --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB" \
    /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/all_solves_db.backup

# Phase 3: Create indexes after data is loaded
echo "Phase 3: Creating indexes after data is loaded..."
pg_restore -v --no-owner --no-privileges --section=post-data \
    --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB" \
    /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/all_solves_db.backup

# Phase 4: Analyze database for optimal query planning
echo "Phase 4: Analyzing database tables for optimized index usage..."
psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "ANALYZE scrambles;"

# Phase 5: Verify data integrity
echo "Phase 5: Verifying data integrity..."
ROWS=$(psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scrambles;" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
echo "Database contains $ROWS rows"
if [ "$ROWS" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Database restore completed successfully"
else
    echo "WARNING: Database restore may have failed - no rows found"
fi
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x restore.sh
```

### Generating Your Own Scrambles

Inside the `scramble_generation` folder, you'll find a `config_scramble_generation.yaml` file where you can configure:

- Number of scrambles to generate
- Buffer pieces
- Event types
- And more...

#### üìã Configuration Tips

- Use the specific combination section to generate solutions only for your preferred buffer combinations
- If this section is empty, it will generate all combinations from your chosen buffers
- Specify the number of scrambles you want to generate

#### üíæ Backup Options

Configure your export format in the backup section:

```yaml
backup:
  enabled: true # Whether to create backups at all
  sqlite_backup: true # Whether to create SQLite backup
```

#### ‚ö° Running the Generation

After configuring your settings, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Generation Time

- The process may take several hours (approximately 4 hours for 10 million scrambles)

#### üîÑ Multiple Generations

- The db will be saved at scramble_generation\db_solves
- New scrambles will be added to the existing database
- You can generate multiple times to accumulate more scrambles
- To start with a fresh database it is not enough to delete the db files, you need to run:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

## üôè Acknowledgments

- [csTimer](https://github.com/cs0x7f/cstimer) - Used the library to generate the scrambles
- [Scrambo](https://github.com/NickColley/scrambo) - Used for generating 4BLD scrambles efficiently
- Java code for analyzing solves - I found this code online a decade ago and used it to develop a BLD android app. But now I didn't manage to find the code online and had been lucky enough to have a local copy that i used.  If you know the original developer, please let me know so I can properly credit them.

- Roman - I had this idea for a couple of years now, but I didn't know how to approach it because I had no clear method for generating custom scrambles. Initially, I considered mathematically constructing scrambles based on specific requirements. However, when I met Roman at WORLDS 2023, he shared his implementation of a similar idea that he used for training challenging cases for the Got Talent show he participated in. He explained that he took a "brute force" approach, generating millions of scrambles. This gave me a completely new perspective and made the problem feel much more solvable.

## üí≠ Additional Thoughts

I hope this tool will make BLD training more efficient and expand the ways people approach training. I believe that practicing and coaching in cubing is an underdeveloped area in our community, and I hope this tool can help advance BLD training.

for example, a common challenge in competitions is handling easy scrambles, where the pressure to perform well can be overwhelming. This tool allows you to simulate these situations, helping you prepare for real competition scenarios. Instead of randomly waiting for easy scrambles, you can now deliberately practice with them.

Similarly, when faced with challenging scrambles (like those with 3 corner twists or 4 flipped edges), you can now generate specific practice sets to improve your handling of these cases.
